# 📊 Smart Data Insight Agent (OpenAI + Streamlit)

This project is a **simple AI-powered data insight tool** built with **Streamlit** and **OpenAI GPT-3.5**.  
It allows users to upload a CSV file, ask natural-language questions about their data, and get intelligent, human-readable insights.

---

## 🚀 Features
- Upload any **CSV file** and instantly preview it.
- Ask questions in plain English — “Which gender scored higher in math?”  
- Uses **OpenAI GPT** for smart, contextual analysis.
- Clean **Streamlit UI** with a responsive layout.
- Includes a **sample dataset (StudentsPerformance.csv)** for demo.

## 🧠 How It Works
1. You upload a CSV file.
2. The app sends the first 10–15 rows to OpenAI GPT.
3. GPT analyzes it and returns an interpreted answer (summary, comparison, etc.).
4. The response is displayed directly in Streamlit.
